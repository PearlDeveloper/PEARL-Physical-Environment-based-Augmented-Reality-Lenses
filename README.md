# Welcome to PEARl prototype 
PEARL is a mixed-reality approach to analysis human movement data in situ. Our work aims to enrich the repertoire of in-situ analysis strategies by visualizing and interacting with the physical surroundings in the same space as the data being recorded. This repository contains the prototype implementation of our proposed Pearl components (Selector, Filter, and Visualizer) and their corresponding functionalities in our ACM CHI 2023 paper. 

This prototype is implemented for Microsoft HoloLens 2 HMD by using Unity 3D, MRTK, and available open-source toolkits, including u2Vis https://github.com/imldresden/u2vis  and MIRIA https://github.com/imldresden/miria. It is being developed for research use. It may contain bugs, including critical security flaws. Do not use this prototype for mission critical purposes.
